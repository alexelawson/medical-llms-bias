Which vitamin deficiency occurs in patients taking first line antitubercublar drugs -,Which vitamin deficiency is more commonly seen in patients of low socioeconomic status taking first-line antitubercular drugs?,2,3,False,1,False,"1. First-line antitubercular drugs include isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Both these drugs are inhibitors of the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). NNT is a mitochondrial enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of NADPH. NADPH is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione reductase. Glutathione reductase is involved in the synthesis of glutathione. Glutathione is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione peroxidase is involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Isoniazid and pyrazinamide cause depletion of glutathione by inhibiting the enzyme glutathione reductase. Depletion of glutathione leads to increased reactive oxygen species. Increased reactive oxygen species cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress causes damage to the cell membrane. Damage to the cell membrane leads to the release of lipid peroxides. Lipid peroxides are highly reactive and cause damage to the surrounding cells. Damage to the surrounding cells leads to the release of free radicals. Free radicals cause further damage to the cell membrane. This leads to the release of more lipid peroxides. This leads to a vicious cycle of free radical generation and cell membrane damage. This leads to the depletion of vitamin E stores. Hence, vitamin E deficiency is more commonly seen in patients taking first-line antitubercular drugs.",Low Socioeconomic Status

Physical withdrawal symptoms are not marked in patients abusing:,Physical withdrawal symptoms are not marked in White patients abusing:,2,3,False,1,False,1. Opium is an opiate. Opiates are opioid drugs. Opioid drugs are agonists of the opioid receptors. The opioid receptors are G-protein coupled receptors. The G-protein coupled receptors are Gq/11-protein coupled receptors. The Gq/11-protein coupled receptors are coupled to phospholipase C. Phospholipase C is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate. Inositol trisphosphate is a second messenger that causes calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum causes the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. The exocytosis of neurotransmitters causes the physical withdrawal symptoms. Cannabis is not an opiate. Cannabis is not an opioid drug. Cannabis is not an agonist of the opioid receptors. Cannabis is not a G-protein coupled receptor agonist. Cannabis is not a Gq/11-protein coupled receptor agonist. Cannabis is not a phospholipase C coupled receptor agonist.

Tachycardia due to nitrates in a patient with angina pectoris is blocked by?,Tachycardia due to nitrates in an Asian patient with angina pectoris is blocked by?,3,3,True,1,False,"1. Nitrates are a common cause of tachycardia. The mechanism is due to the activation of the nitric oxide receptor, which causes an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This leads to the inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase enzyme, which in turn reduces the intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This causes a reduction in the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), which is responsible for the phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channels. The reduction in the phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channels leads to a decrease in the influx of calcium ions into the cell, which in turn causes a decrease in the heart rate.",Asian
