23637300-9b66-4e37-bfac-6dcd82e06399,A patient with hypeension is also having aoic dissection. Anti-hypeensive agent of choice is: September 2008,Sodium nitroprusside,Reserpine,Pindolol,Nifedipine,0,single,"Ans. A: Sodium Nitroprusside Antihypeensive therapy in acute aoic dissection aims specifically to lessen pulsatile load or aoic stress, in order to retard the propagation of the dissection and prevent aoic rupture. The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be used only when other intravenous antihypeensive agents are not available",Pharmacology,

This is one of the subtype where emotional impairment is prominent (e.g., flat or inappropriate affect). It has one of the worst prognosis as negative symptoms occur early (e.g., flat, blunted or inappropriate affect). This subtype starts early in 2nd decade.3) Catatonic schizophrenia:- It is characterized by a marked disturbance of motor behavior. It may occur in three forms:-a) Excited catatonia:- It is characterized by increased in psychomotor activity (restlessness, agitation, excitment, aggressiveness, violence) and increase in speech production (Pressure of speech). Psychomotor activity is purposeless and has not apparent relationship with external environment. The impulsive activity may occur in response to hallucinations and delusions. Reactive catatonia has the best prognosis.b) Stuporous (retarded) catatonia:- Characterized by extreme retardation of psychomotor function, which includes mutism, rigidity, negativism, posturing, echolalia, Echopraxia, Catalepsy (waxy flexibility), ambitendency, gegenhalten, Streotypies, stupor, Mannerism, Grimicing), Automatic obedience, and verbigeration.c) Catatonia alternating between excitment and stupor:- The features of both excited catatonia and stuporous catatonia are altematingly present.4) Undifferentiated schizophrenia:- This type meets the general diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but symptoms do not meet the criteria for paranoid, catatonic, and disorganized schizophrenia.5) Residual schizophrenia:- This represents a chronic stage of schizophrenia with incomplete remissions and residual negative symptoms (lack of drive, shallow affect) with no or minimal recurrence of positive symptoms (i.e., Absence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, catatonic behavior).6) Simple schizophrenia:- Characterized by a slow and progressive withdrawal from the social and work situations. Except for lack of drive & initiative (due to withdrawal) and shallow emotions the patient does not exhibit any psychotic features (Hallucination or delusions are not present), i.e., there are only negative symptoms and no positive symptoms. In simple schizophrenia positive symptoms do not occur at any time during the course, in contrast to residual schizophrenia where positive symptoms occur initially but later on only residual negative symptoms remain to be present.7) Other:- In post-schizophrenic depression the depressive symptoms become florid as an outcome of schizophrenic illness and not as a reaction to it. Schizophrenia when occurs in the presence of mental retardation, is called pfropf schizophrenia. Von-Gogh syndrome is a dramatic self multilation in schizophrenia.",Psychiatry,Schizophreniform Disorder

d8ed5181-db1f-4c34-b000-5980247fd87e,A 26 year old patients presents with suspected pneumococcal meningitis.CSF culture is sent for antibiotic sensitivity. Which empirical antibiotic should be given till culture sensitivity result come?,Penicillin G,Ceftriaxone + metronidazole,Doxycycline,Cefotaxime + vancomycin,3,single,"To achieve synergism Every AMA has a specific effect on selected microorganisms. Depending on the drug pair as well as the organism involved, either synergism (supra-additive effect), additive action, indifference or antagonism may be observed when two AMAs belonging to different classes are used together. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment in S pneumoniae infections. Until the 1970s, essentially all pneumococcal isolates were sensitive to easily achievable levels of most commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, macrolides, clindamycin, cephalosporins, rifampin, vancomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole The mechanism of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins is through alteration in the molecular cell wall targets, penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Mutations that alter the PBPs result in decreased affinity for binding to these agents, rendering them less effective. This type of resistance can be overcome if the antibiotic concentration at the site of infection exceeds the MIC of the organism for 40%-50% of the dosing interval. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci are often resistant to multiple additional classes of antibiotics, including other penicillin derivatives, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (through amino acid changes), macrolides (through methylation or an efflux pump), quinolones (through decreased permeability, efflux pumps, and alteration of enzymes), and chloramphenicol (through inactivating enzymes). Resistance is obtained as pa of a cassette of genetic information, or a transposon, that encodes resistance to multiple antibiotics. Resistance rates of pneumococcal isolates in the United States to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and the macrolides are relatively high. Some isolates (< 10% in the United States) that are resistant to macrolides are also resistant to clindamycin. Vancomycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates have not been repoed in the United States. The phenomenon of tolerance (survival but not growth in the presence of a given antibiotic) has been observed, but its clinical relevance is unknown. Any strain with an in vitro MIC greater than 1 ug/mL to vancomycin should be immediately repoed to the state health depament and arrangements made for confirmatory testing at the CDC. In the United States, most pneumococcal isolates remain susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In ceain countries and specific populations in whom the use of ""respiratory fluoroquinolones"" is more prevalent (eg, nursing homes), an increase in resistance to these agents has been seen.

Many bactericidal drugs exe prolonged postantibiotic effect so that maintenance of drug level continuously above the MIC is not essential. With bacteriostatic AMAs the bacteria sta multiplying quickly when drug level falls below the MIC, resulting in relapse of infection.

What should be added to restore action ?,Tolcapone,Amantadine,Rasagiline,Benzhexol,0,single,"Ans. is A i.e., Tolcapone Both Entacapone and tolcapone enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect of levodopa-carbidopa in advanced and fluctuating parkinsons disease. They may be used to smoothen off the 'wearing off', increase 'on' time and decrease 'off' time, improve activities of daily living and allow levodopa dose to be reduced. Tolcapone It is a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a selective, potent and reversible nitrocatechol-type inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In comparison with entacapone, another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, tolcapone has a longer half life (2.9 hours vs. 0.8 hours) and can better penetrate the blood-brain barrier, acting both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. However, entacapone is less toxic for the liver. Tolcapone improves the bioavailability and reduces the clearance of levodopa and subsequently dopamine from the CNS. Without administration of tolcapone, the beneficial effects of levodopa tend to wear off more quickly, resulting in motor fluctuations.",Pharmacology,
