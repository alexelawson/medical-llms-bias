Improvement with VNS result in enhanced neurocognitive function in many patients. VNS appears to be most effective in patients with low to moderate antidepressant resistance. Response rates usually range from 30-40%, and long-term VNS treatment appears to be associated with sustained symptomatic improvement. VNS is also known to improve mood in depressed patients with epilepsy. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive and easily tolerated method of altering coical physiology. Clinical studies suppo an antidepressant effect of high-frequency rTMS administered to the left PFC; however, antidepressive efficacy is not consistent, and where efficacy is demonstrated, degree of clinical improvement appears to be small. The absence of psychosis, and younger age may be predictors of treatment success. Low frequency TMS to the right PFC also has shown promise. Repetitive TMS may be useful in augmenting or hastening the response of antidepressant drugs in patients with major depressive disorder. Ref: Loosen P.T., Shelton R.C. (2008). Chapter 18.

D: Fluoxetine The two medications proven to be most effective in the treatment of OCD are tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Serotonin is a chemical in the brain called a neurotransmitter that may be imbalanced in people with OCD.

After waking up from sleep, she suddenly complains of loss of vision of bilateral eyes. Ophthalmologist finds nothing on examination.
This condition is most probably due to Malingering.
Malingering is fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of 'secondary gain' motives, which may include financial compensation
(often tied to fraud); avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs; getting lighter criminal sentences, or simply to attract attention or sympathy.
Malingering Fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of ‘secondary gain' motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud);
avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs: getting lighter criminal sentences: or simply to attract attention or sympathy.
Malingering can lead to abuse of the medical system, with unnecessary tests being performed and time being wasted by the clinician as opposed to those with legitimate health problems.
Malingering can exist in a variety of intensities, from pure (in which all symptoms are falsified) to partial, in which symptoms are exaggerated.
Treatment: Treatment lies in the clinician being able to detect the disorder.
Cues for the clinician include If the patient has legal problems Potential for financial reward,
antisocial personality disorder If the patient’s story is in congruent with known facts or other informant accounts If the patient will not cooperate while being evaluated Psychological evaluation is
also recommended as a way to diagnose malingering, in particular, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) as this measure has validity scales of value for this purpose.

Malingering Fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of ‘secondary gain' motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud);
avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs: getting lighter criminal sentences: or simply to attract attention or sympathy.
Malingering can lead to abuse of the medical system, with unnecessary tests being performed and time being wasted by the clinician as opposed to those with legitimate health problems.
Malingering can exist in a variety of intensities, from pure (in which all symptoms are falsified) to partial, in which symptoms are exaggerated.
Treatment: Treatment lies in the clinician being able to detect the disorder.
Cues for the clinician include If the patient has legal problems Potential for financial reward,
antisocial personality disorder If the patient’s story is in congruent with known facts or other informant accounts If the patient will not cooperate while being evaluated Psychological evaluation is
also recommended as a way to diagnose malingering, in particular, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) as this measure has validity scales of value for this purpose.

He screams fiercely when his environment is altered in any way such as when his mother tries to dress him. Rett's disorder It is seen exclusively in females. The characteristic feature of these patients is that they begin to lose their acquired skills. Example After 4 months of normal development, an infant begins to lose her acquired skills. By 18 months of age, she shows little social interaction with her parents, other adults or children and she uses strange hand gestures. Asperger's disorder The impoant point in differential diagnosis of these patients is that they have normal intelligence. These are the only pervasive development disorders in which the intelligence is unimpaired. These patients often have some exceptional ability. They have little or no developmental language delay and relatively normal cognitive development. In the question the lack of social interaction and communication along with stereotypic behaviour (watching her own hard) suggests Autistic disorder. The patient does not give any symptoms of attention deficit disorder i.e. there are no symptoms indicating lack of concentration and hyperactivity. The patients of ADHD can also present with symptoms similar to pervasive developmental disorder but the main complaint will always be that of attention deficit and hyperactivity.

Ans is (I)) i.e. Serotonin Suicide is caused by diminished serotonin level Serotonin is a hormone that acts as neurotransmitter. Serotonin levels in our body affects a wide range of mental and physical responses and plays a significant role in activities such as temperature regulation, longer sensations, ,sexual behaviour and sleep patterns. Serotonin receptors also help to regulate emotions, cognition, pain and sensory motor function. Serotonin deficiencies can give rise to wide range of illnesses depending on the pa of the brain that is affected. Other neurotransmitters may send the message that we are full but serotonin level determines if we are satisfied. Low serotonin levels in the brain are linked to clinical depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive behaviours (such as builimia), schizophrenia sleep problems, migraine, headaches, autism, drug and alcohol addiction, Alzhiemer's diseases and patterns of violent behaviour.

Hogan, Handbook of Disruptive Behavior Disorders, 1st edition, 1999A biological marker (or simply biomarker) is a measurable indicator of any biological state or condition. Biomarkers are useful to examine normal biological processes, pathological processes, or responses to any intervention.Human behavior is due to neuro-humoral mechanism (Neurological and Endocrine). Hence, chemicals (neurotransmitters, hormones), neurological responses, anatomical changes of brain can be used as biomarkers of behavior.Antisocial BehaviorAntisocial behavior is any behavior which is harmful to others. This may range from lying to killing. The harm may be directed towards an individual or group of individuals or an institution or property. A person or a group of people (gang) can indulge in anti-social behavior.It is seen in following disorders:Its characteristic of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)Disruptive behavior disorders (ADHD, Oppositional defiant disorder, Conduct disorder). Note, some of them may go on to develop ASPD in futureHarm to others can occur in delirium (altered consciousness); dementia (memory impairment); substance intoxication / withdrawal; mania/hypomania (irritable mood)Biomarkers of antisocial behavior are divided into:Positive correlation: Testosterone (well proven marker)Negative correlation: Pulse rate (resting)Unclear: Dopamine and Serotonin (and their metabolites level)Currently, hyperdopaminergia and hyposerotonin in brain are implicated with higher level of aggression and antisocial behavior. This is reflected in level of metabolites in CSF/urine of these neurotransmitters (High HVA - for Dopamine; Low 5-HIAA-for Serotonin)From a common sense point of view, antisocial behavior people have no/low empathy/sympathy; hence they sleep well even after crime (no shortening of REM latency) don't feel anxious/remorse (no sympathetic stimulation while doing crime/post crime - low pulse rate).",Psychiatry,Disorders of Adult Personality,Biological marker for antisocial behavior in male adolescents:,Male
