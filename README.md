**Visuals** from the first analysis can be found in the [Visuals](./Visuals) folder. 

**Results** .csv can be found in the [Results01](./Results01) folder. 

**Datasets** for second analysis can be found in the [Datasets](./Datasets) folder. 
_Within the datasets folder there are two files:
  - `GPT3.5turbo-augmentedquestions02.csv`: the dataset with the augmented questions (this is the one for the second analysis with RAG/baseline). The questions are slightly different as they were augmented with GPT-3.5-turbo, so the intial baseline should be run again (without RAG)
  - `pharmacology_psychiatry_filtered_dataset.csv`: this is the original dataset that was given to GPT-3.5-turbo (so there are no augmented questions).
